## What I did today:
- PR for top navbar links fix is raised in two parts : 
    - Main PR: jenkins-io-components #164
    - Supplemental PR: docs.jenkins.io #318
- I have solved the issue [#200](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/issues/200) . This PR adds all the authors' data in the correct format under site/authors. Even though we will rebuild the site from scratch using Gatsby, I figured we’d need this same data over there too—so I’ve added it here for now. Should make things easier to just copy-paste into the new repo when the time comes ..We kickoff gatsby part after tomorrow meet . The PR. : [#319](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/pull/319)
- Also working on getting the files for gatsby non versioned content by June 10 , mainly for the next week from June 10-17 those pages which will be done
