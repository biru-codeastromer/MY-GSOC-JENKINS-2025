## What I did today:
- The work continues on syncing the docs.jenkins.io repository with the latest state of files from the jenkins.io repo
- I used the approach given by Kris
- First I created a python script to fetch all the changed files in the jenkins.io repo using github API.Then it stored the list of changed files in another file from where I used beyond compare to see how both the files in docs.jenkins.io and jenkins.io are different.
- Then I made changes to the docs.jenkins.io as per required.
