## What I did today:
- Started working on the task told by Kris to update the docs.jenkins.io repo to reflect the latest state of files in the jenkins.io repo.
- Created a PR to fix the React dependency issue: [#285](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/pull/285)
- Also created an PR in jenkins-pipeline-utility repo to correct a link in our jenkins.io website [#307](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-utility-steps-plugin/pull/307)
- I was using link checker tools to check for broken links in jenkins.io site.
