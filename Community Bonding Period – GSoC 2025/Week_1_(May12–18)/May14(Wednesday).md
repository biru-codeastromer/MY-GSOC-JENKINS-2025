## What I did today:
    - Looking into the issue [Implement Jenkins LTS Upgrade Guide #87](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/issues/87)
    - Making draft code to see if it works or not, and I have also mentioned its implementation in my proposal.
    - I plan to discuss this with my mentors in the first weekly meeting.
