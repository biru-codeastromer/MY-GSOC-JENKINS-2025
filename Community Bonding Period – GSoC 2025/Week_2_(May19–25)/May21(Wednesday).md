## What I did today:
- Created a detailed Notion checklist based on our first weekly meeting (May 20) to track tasks and action items, and shared it with the mentors.
- Opened a GitHub issue to track metadata/SEO enhancement for docs.jenkins.io, as discussed during the meeting.
- Opened part 1 pr for updating the docs.jenkins.io [#296](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/pull/296)
- Currently working on more updates
- Also writing my blog post in google docs to show to mentors soon
