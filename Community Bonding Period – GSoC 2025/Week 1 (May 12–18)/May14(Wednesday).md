## What I did today:
    - Looking into the issue [**Implement Jenkins LTS Upgrade Guide  #87**](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/issues/87)
    - Making draft code to see if it works or not and also I have mentioned about it's implementation in my proposal too.
    - Likewise I will discuss this with my mentors on first weekly meeting.
