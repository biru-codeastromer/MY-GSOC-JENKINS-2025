## What I did today:
    - Studied the issue : [**Implement Pipeline Steps Reference in GatsbyÂ #86**](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/issues/86)
    - Thanks to Kris for having already setting up the useful issues in the [docs.jenkins.io repo](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/docs.jenkins.io/issues) beforehand
    - I have written a implementation of it in my proposal before , so now keeping a more boiler code powerful ready for it to discuss with mentors after our first weekly meet
